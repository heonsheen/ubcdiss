I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dinesh Pai, for all the advice and support through my studies.
It is thanks to his continued guidance that the past two years were so valuable and enjoyable to me.

I would also like to thank Egor, Edwin, and Ye for their collaboration and for all the valuable discussions that we had which were a source of so much insight.

Thanks to everyone in the lab, in particular Prashant, Jan, and Ziheng for their valuable friendships in the lab that made the work environment so delightful.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents Dongwoo and Youngnan, my siblings Yoon and Nara, and my four dogs, for their love and suppport.
