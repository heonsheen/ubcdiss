\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dinesh Pai, for all the advice and support through my studies.
It is thanks to his continued guidance that the past two years were so valuable and enjoyable to me.

I would also like to thank Egor Larionov, Edwin Chen, and Ye Fan for their collaboration and for all the valuable discussions that we had which were a source of so much insight.

Thanks to everyone in the lab, in particular Prashant Sachdeva, Jan Hansen, and Ziheng Liang for their valuable friendships in the lab that made the work environment so delightful.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents Dongwoo Sheen and Youngnan Park, my siblings Yoon and Nara Sheen, and my four dogs, for their love and support.
