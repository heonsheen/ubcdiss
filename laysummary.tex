\chapter{Lay Summary}

Volume preservation is an important feature in simulation of biological tissues.
However, current methods in computer graphics either lose significant volume under deformation, or results in "locking" where the material appears unnaturally stiff.
In this thesis we propose a solution to resolve this problem by preserving volumes in anatomical zones instead of local elements, and controlling local volume through a novel inversion-avoidant penalty.
We also propose a simple model of the epidermis that provides a more organic deformation.
