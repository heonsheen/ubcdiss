\chapter{Preface}

All the work presented in this thesis is a product of a collaboration between Seung Heon Sheen, Egor Larionov, Ye Fan, Dinesh Pai, and Vital Mechanics Research Inc.
Pai proposed the volume preservation constraint and the epidermis model and supervised the research.
Sheen developed the ideas further and implemented all the software for the volume preservation and the epidermis models. 
Vital Mechanics contributed the simulation mesh and the data for Figure~\ref{fig:teaser} and the soft tissue simulation code used in this research.
Larionov and Fan contributed to discussions and the soft tissue simulation code, including the friction model used in Figure~\ref{fig:teaser}, and helped with writing the paper in preparation for submission to ACM TOG, upon which this thesis is based.

The research was partly funded by Vital Mechanics Research Inc. and NSERC, through an Idea-To-Innovation (I2I) grant.
